# Space Cubics Website

This is a corporate website built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)
- a static site generator written in Rust.

## 🚀 Quick Start


### Install Zola

See: https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/

### Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/spacecubics/www
cd www
```

### Build

```
zola build
```

### Check

```
zola serve
```

## 📰 Add a News Article
1. Create a new file in `content/news/`
2. Name it by date. ex) `2025-06-01.md` and `2025-06-01.en.md`
3. Add title (string) and date (YYYY-MM-DD) variables to front matter.
4. Add link variable under [extra] if article has external link.
5. Add your news.

   ```
   +++
   title = "「JAXAベンチャー」の認定"
   date = 2018-05-29

   [extra]
   link = "https://aerospacebiz.jaxa.jp/venture/"
   +++

   Content here...
   ```

As shown above, there are two date values: one in the file name and
one in the `date` variable. We haven’t been able to remove the
redundant `date` field due to a limitation in Zola. See issue #114 for
details.

If you need a line break, do not use two trailing spaces at the end of
a line, because they are very hard to notice and, as programmers, we
are not used to writing any trailing whitespace. Please use an
explicit `<br>` tag for line breaks.

    ```
    These lines<br>
    should be two lines.
    ```

### Linking to Local Pages

A link to a local page must include the `@/` prefix.

In your `.md` file, create a link like this:

```
[here](@/products/scobc_a1.md)
```

Or, if you are calling one of our shortcodes:

```
{% hero_element(
    title = "PRODUCTS",
    link = "@/products/_index.md",
    link_text = "Details"
) %}
```

This ensures the correct link is generated for the page, based on its
language.
